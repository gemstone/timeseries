            This class synchronizes (i.e., sorts by timestamp) real-time measurements.
            </para>
        <para>
            Note that your lag time should be defined as it relates to the rate at which data is coming
            into the concentrator. Make sure you allow enough time for transmission of data over the network
            allowing any needed time for possible network congestion.  Lead time should be defined as your
            confidence in the accuracy of your local clock (e.g., if you set lead time to 2, this means you
            trust that your local clock is within plus or minus 2 seconds of real-time.)
            </para>
        <para>
            This concentrator is designed to sort measurements being transmitted in real-time for data being
            sent at rates of at least 1 sample per second. Slower rates (e.g., once every few seconds) are not
            supported since sorting data at these speeds would be trivial. There is no defined maximum number
            of supported samples per second - but keep in mind that CPU utilization will increase as the
            measurement volume and frame rate increase.

      <summary>
            Gets or sets the desired processing interval, in milliseconds, for the adapter.
            </summary>
      <remarks>
        <para>
            This property is normally only used when you need the concentrator to send data at faster than real-time speeds,
            e.g., faster than the defined <see cref="P:Gemstone.Timeseries.ConcentratorBase.FramesPerSecond" />. A use case would be pushing historical data through
            the concentrator where you want to sort and publish data as quickly as possible.
            </para>
        <para>
            With the exception of the values of -1 and 0, this value specifies the desired processing interval for data, e.g.,
            a timer interval, over which to process data. A value of -1 means to use the default processing interval, i.e., use
            the <see cref="P:Gemstone.Timeseries.ConcentratorBase.FramesPerSecond" />, while a value of 0 means to process data as fast as possible.
            </para>
        <para>
            From a real-time perspective the <see cref="T:Gemstone.Timeseries.ConcentratorBase" /> defines its general processing interval based on
            the defined <see cref="P:Gemstone.Timeseries.ConcentratorBase.FramesPerSecond" /> property. The frames per second property, however, is more than a basic
            processing interval since it is used to define the intervals in one second that will become the time sorting
            destination "buckets" used by the concentrator irrespective of the data rate of the incoming data. As an example,
            if the frames per second of the concentrator is set to 30 and the source data rate is 60fps, then data will be
            down-sampled to 30 frames of sorted incoming data but the assigned processing interval will be used to publish the
            frames at the specified rate.
            </para>
        <para>
            The implemented functionality of the process interval property will be to respond to values in the following way:
            <list type="table"><listheader><term>Value</term><description>Response</description></listheader><item><term>&lt; 0</term><description>
                    In this case the default processing interval has been requested, as a result the <see cref="P:Gemstone.Timeseries.ConcentratorBase.ProcessByReceivedTimestamp" />
                    will be set to <c>false</c> and the concentrator processing interval will be defined based on the currently defined
                    <see cref="P:Gemstone.Timeseries.ConcentratorBase.FramesPerSecond" /> property, e.g., if the frames per second is 30 the processing interval will be 33.33ms.
                    </description></item><item><term>0</term><description>
                    In this case the processing interval has been defined to process data as fast as possible, as a result the
                    <see cref="P:Gemstone.Timeseries.ConcentratorBase.ProcessByReceivedTimestamp" /> property will be set to <c>true</c> and <see cref="P:Gemstone.Timeseries.ConcentratorBase.UsePrecisionTimer" /> property
                    will be set to <c>false</c>. With a processing interval of zero data is expected to flow into the concentrator as quick as
                    it can be provided. The <see cref="P:Gemstone.Timeseries.ConcentratorBase.FramesPerSecond" /> property will still be used to sort data by time into appropriate
                    frames, but the concentrator will use the reception time of the measurements against the defined lag-time to make sure
                    needed data has arrived before publication and frames will be published at the same rate of data arrival.
                    </description></item><item><term>&gt; 0</term><description>
                    In this case a specific processing interval has been defined for processing data, as a result both the
                    <see cref="P:Gemstone.Timeseries.ConcentratorBase.ProcessByReceivedTimestamp" /> and <see cref="P:Gemstone.Timeseries.ConcentratorBase.UsePrecisionTimer" /> properties will be set to <c>true</c>. With
                    a specifically defined processing interval, data is expected to flow into the concentrator at a similar rate. The
                    <see cref="P:Gemstone.Timeseries.ConcentratorBase.FramesPerSecond" /> property will still be used to sort data by time into appropriate frames, but the concentrator
                    will use the reception time of the measurements against the defined lag-time to make sure needed data has arrived before
                    publication and frames will be published on the specified interval. If multiple frames are ready for publication when the
                    processing interval executes, then all the ready frames will be published sequentially as quickly as possible.

            If user implemented publication function consistently exceeds available publishing time (i.e., <c>1 / <see cref="P:Gemstone.Timeseries.ConcentratorBase.FramesPerSecond" /></c> seconds),
            concentration will fall behind. A small amount of this time is required by the <see cref="T:Gemstone.Timeseries.ConcentratorBase" /> for processing overhead, so actual total time
            available for user function process will always be slightly less than <c>1 / <see cref="P:Gemstone.Timeseries.ConcentratorBase.FramesPerSecond" /></c> seconds.

            tolerances as specified by the <see cref="P:Gemstone.Timeseries.ConcentratorBase.LeadTime" /> value.
            </summary>
      <remarks>
            Because the measurements being received by remote devices are often measured relative to GPS time, these timestamps
            are typically more accurate than the local clock. As a result, we can use the latest received timestamp as the best
            local time measurement we have (ignoring transmission delays); but, even these times can be incorrect so we still have
            to apply reasonability checks to these times. To do this, we use the local system time and the <see cref="P:Gemstone.Timeseries.ConcentratorBase.LeadTime" />
            value to validate the latest measured timestamp. If the newest received measurement timestamp gets too old or creeps
            too far into the future (both validated + and - against defined lead time property value), we will fall back on local
            system time. Note that this creates a dependency on a fairly accurate local clock - the smaller the lead time deviation
            tolerance, the better the needed local clock accuracy. For example, a lead time deviation tolerance of a few seconds
            might only require keeping the local clock synchronized to an NTP time source; but, a sub-second tolerance would
            require that the local clock be very close to GPS time.

      <remarks>
            Action adapters are in the curious position of being able to both consume and produce points, as such the user needs to be able to control how their
            adapter will behave concerning routing demands when the adapter is set up to connect on demand. In the case of respecting auto-start input demands,
            as an example, this would be <c>false</c> for an action adapter that calculated measurement, but <c>true</c> for an action adapter used to archive inputs.

            This method defines a temporal processing constraint for an adapter, i.e., the start and stop time over which an
            adapter will process data. Actual implementation of the constraint will be adapter specific. Implementations
            should be able to dynamically handle multiple calls to this function with new constraints. Passing in <c>null</c>
            for the <paramref name="startTime" /> and <paramref name="stopTime" /> should cancel the temporal constraint and
            return the adapter to standard / real-time operation.

      <remarks>
            For output adapters that archive data it is assumed that the desired behavior will be to not support temporal processing
            since the data being processed has already been archived (i.e., no need to attempt to re-archive old data). As a result
            the default behavior for an output adapter is to not support temporal processing when <see cref="P:Gemstone.Timeseries.Adapters.OutputAdapterBase.OutputIsForArchive" />
            is <c>true</c>. If you have an output adapter that you want to support temporal data processing independent of the
            <see cref="P:Gemstone.Timeseries.Adapters.OutputAdapterBase.OutputIsForArchive" /> value, then override this property and force the base value to the desired state.

        <see pref="eventName" /> should be a constant string value associated with what type of message is being
            generated. In general, there should only be a few dozen distinct event names per class. Exceeding this
            threshold will cause the EventName to be replaced with a general warning that a usage issue has occurred.
